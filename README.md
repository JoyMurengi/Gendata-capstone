##  Project Title  
**She Deserved to Live: A Data Story on Femicide**

## Project Description  
This project explores the tragic reality of femicide in Kenya, focusing on data from 2016 to 2025. It aims to document and analyze cases of gender-based killings, tell the stories behind the numbers, and help raise awareness through data-driven storytelling.

## Purpose / Problem Solved  
Femicide cases are often underreported or lost in the news cycle. This project aims to create a central, accessible platform that not only highlights these cases but also gives a voice to the women behind the data. By combining scraping and visualization, the project sheds light on trends, regions affected, and the urgency of intervention.

## Planned Features  
- Web scraping of recent cases (2024–2025)  
- Dashboard showing number of cases by year,agegroup,region   
- Summary statistics and insights  
- Personal stories linked to select cases (where available)

## Technologies / Concepts I Plan to Use  
- Python (Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup)   
- Excel for data cleaning
- SQL 
- Tableau

## Data Source  
- A previously existing dataset (2016–2023) collected by Kenyan feminists and activists  
- Real-time news scraping for data from 2024–2025 (standard Kenyan news sources and archives)

## Success Criteria  
- Cleaned and structured dataset with consistent fields  
- A working dashboard for visualization  
- A published Lovable website explaining the story through data  

##  Stretch Goals  
- Intergrating a chatbot 
- Predictive modeling for identifying high-risk regions
- Integration of audio or visual storytelling for impact
