# Project Title
WaterTrack: Global Analysis of Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (2000–2017)

## Project Description
WaterTrack is a data analytics project that explores global trends in access to basic and safely managed drinking water, sanitation services, and hygiene infrastructure. Using tools like Excel, SQL, and Tableau, the project breaks down historical data by country, region, and population type (rural, urban, total) to uncover disparities and progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation for All).

## Problem Solved / Purpose
Even in 2024, millions of people worldwide still lack access to clean water and adequate sanitation. This project aims to:
- Analyze historical progress from 2000 to 2017.
- Identify which countries and regions are most at risk.
- Support advocacy and planning by revealing patterns and gaps.
- Practice real-world data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization in key analytics tools.

## Planned Features
- Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, statistical summaries  
- SQL: Aggregation queries by region/year, filtering for outliers, trend analysis  
- Tableau: Interactive dashboards, time series charts, regional heatmaps  
- Comparison of rural vs urban access  
- Trend tracking for open defecation, handwashing availability, and sanitation access  
- Ranking of countries by progress or lack thereof

## Technologies / Concepts I Plan to Use
- Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, IF conditions, charts)
- SQL (GROUP BY, WHERE, JOIN, aggregate functions like AVG, COUNT)
- Tableau (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, filters, interactive dashboards)
- Data storytelling and clean data presentation
- KPI tracking for sanitation-related indicators

## Data Source
- indexes.csv – A multi-country dataset (2000–2017)  
  - Includes metrics like:
    - Population using basic/safely managed drinking water
    - Population using basic/safely managed sanitation
    - Handwashing facility access
    - Prevalence of open defecation
  - Broken down by Country, Region, and Population Type (Total, Rural, Urban)

## Success Criteria
- Cleaned and structured dataset ready for SQL queries and Excel analysis  
- Accurate, well-documented dashboards in Tableau  
- Key insights clearly stated (e.g., top 5 and bottom 5 countries by sanitation access)  
- At least 3 high-impact visualizations  
- Final output tells a clear, insightful story with real-world relevance

## Stretch Goals
- Compare progress rates between countries over time
- Add external data (e.g., GDP or health outcomes) for deeper correlation
- Create an executive summary slide deck to present findings professionally
