##  Project Title  
**She Deserved to Live: A Data Story on Femicide**

## Project Description  
This project explores the tragic and urgent issue of femicide in Kenya, covering data from 2016 to 2025. It aims to document gender-based killings, reveal patterns and trends, and tell the stories of the women behind the numbers. Through data-driven storytelling, the project seeks to drive awareness and advocacy.

## Purpose / Problem Solved  
Femicide in Kenya is often underreported or quickly forgotten. This project creates a central, accessible platform that tracks and visualizes these cases over time. By using data and storytelling, it ensures these women are not just statistics, and helps the public and policymakers see the urgency of action.

##  Planned Features  
- Web scraping of femicide cases from 2024–2025  
- Dashboard showing trends by year, age group, and region  
- Summary statistics and analytical insights  
- Integration of personal stories and case highlights (where available)

##  Technologies / Concepts Used  
- **Python** (Web scraping with BeautifulSoup)  
- **Excel** (Data cleaning and preprocessing)  
- **SQL** (Data querying and structuring)  
- **Tableau** (Interactive dashboards and geographic visualizations)  

##  Data Sources  
- Public dataset (2016–2023) compiled by Kenyan feminists and gender justice organizations  
- Real-time scraping from major Kenyan news sources for 2024–2025  

## Success Criteria  
- A cleaned, up-to-date dataset covering 2016–2025  
- Tableau dashboard with maps, yearly trends, and demographic breakdowns  
- A Lovable-published website that presents the data story in a powerful, accessible format  

## Stretch Goals  
- Integrating a chatbot to guide users through the data  
- Building predictive models to identify high-risk regions  
- Including multimedia (audio/visual) content for more powerful storytelling
