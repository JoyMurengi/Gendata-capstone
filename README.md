## Project Title

**Unseen Streams: Tracking Global Gaps in Water , Sanitation & Hygiene**

---

## 1. Project Summary

Unseen Streams explores disparities in global access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene using WHO/UNICEF data. Built with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Firebase Studio, it visualizes trends by country, region, and population type to support action on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation for All).

## 2. Objectives

* Analyze global trends in WASH access from 2000 to 2017
* Compare urban vs rural access to basic services
* Identify countries and regions with the most and least progress
* Visualize relationships between sanitation access, hygiene, and public health outcomes
* Build an interactive platform for storytelling using Firebase Studio

---

## 3. Research Questions

1. How has drinking water access changed by WHO region (2000–2017)?
2. What is the link between sanitation and open defecation?
3. How does urban vs. rural access to sanitation and hygiene compare?
4. Which countries improved most in basic sanitation?
5. How is handwashing access distributed across African nations?
6. How do trends in water access relate to open defecation rates?
